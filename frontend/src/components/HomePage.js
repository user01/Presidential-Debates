            The game was derived from a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/2016-us-presidential-debates">
              public domain data set on Kaggle
            </a> of the 2016 US Presidential Debates.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data was cleaned, reduced to features, and the speaker was modeled with a Random
            Forest. The algorithim correctly predicted who spoke each line with an 80% success rate.
            The full code for the model and
            this site can be viewed on <a href="https://github.com/user01/PresidentialDebates">
