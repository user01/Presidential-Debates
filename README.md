# Presidential Debates

This project performs data cleaning, feature engineering, and prediction models
on transcripts of each of the 2016 US Presidential Debates.

## Environment

The project makes use of the [conda package manager](http://conda.pydata.org/)
to store dependencies. The file `environment.yml` contains the required
information. Load the default environment with:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
source activate presidential-debates
```

To build the frontend code, [node](https://nodejs.org/) dependencies must be installed.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Run

Execute the pipeline with `make`.
